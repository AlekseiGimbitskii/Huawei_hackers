## Tampere University of Technology.
## Huawei AI hackathon 2018.
## TextDetector for visualy impaired persons.
The idea of our project is to use machine learning and advanced camera capabilities of Huawei P20 to help people with bad sight in their daily life. In our case we try to develop Android application which will use text recognition to find certain words in the environment, for example allergens on labels or any words which important for user. Also we try to use speech recognition to control the app.
To implement OCR, we use ML Kit from Firebase Google. To implement speech recognition, we use TensorFlow Lite API and model already trained by TensorFlow developers.
